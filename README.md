# Binary search problems

---

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the binary search algorithm, showcasing both iterative and recursive approaches. Additionally, it offers C++ solutions to various well-known problems that rely on binary search logic. These problems include determining the number of rotations in a sorted array, finding the total occurrences of a specific number, and searching for an element in a circularly sorted array.
